**Describe the feature**
- What is your request?
- How is it helpful?
- How is it used?
- If the feature involves new plugins, include links to them
- If the feature involves replacement of current functionality, how the new
  functionality is better?
- If the feature is implemented in another editor or Emacs distro:
  - Include screenshots or screencasts of it
  - Include links to its implementation
  - Include names of commands (and not just the keybinds to invoke them)


**System information**
<details><pre>
Include the output of `M-x doom/info` or `~/.emacs.d/bin/doom info` here.

It's possible Doom already has the feature you're requesting. This will tell me
why you aren't seeing it.
